# üìÇ Public Bug Bounty Targets Data
---
By [**BugBountyResources**](https://github.com/BugBountyResources)

![Logo](logo_bbr.png)

A collection of over **5.1M sub-domains and assets** belonging to bug bounty targets, all put in a single file (using a [script](https://github.com/BugBountyResources/targets/blob/main/targets_extract.py) ).

Goal of this repo is to track changes in targets and add/remove new/old targets, in order to perform reconnaissance en-masse, by putting them all in one place.
Collecting all sub-domains at one place can make certain bulk operations like bulk vulnerability testing by fingerprinting easy, all at once!

Also, it is supposed to work as a **mirror** of the [ProjectDiscovery's public bug bounty assets recon data](https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io).

## ‚öíÔ∏è Workflow
  - Extract target data from [Chaos](https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io/), using the [targets_extract.py script](https://github.com/BugBountyResources/targets/blob/main/targets_extract.py)
  - Push data to GitHub
