# Public Bug Bounty Targets Data
---
![Logo](logo_bbr.png)

Goal of this repo is to track changes in targets and add/remove new/old targets, in order to perform reconnaissance en-masse, by putting them all in one place.
Could be useful to fingerprint vulnerable software by scanning all sub-domains and assets at once. 

Also, it is supposed to work as a **mirror** for [ProjectDiscovery's public bug bounty assets recon data](https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io).
